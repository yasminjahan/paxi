            <h2>Steps to Track Your Parcel Using Paxi Tracking</h2>
            <p>Tracking a parcel using <a href="https://paxitrack.com/">Paxi tracking</a> system is straightforward. To ensure a smooth experience, follow these simple steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Obtain Your Tracking Number</strong>
                    <p>Before you can start tracking your parcel, you need a unique tracking number, which is usually provided by the sender (if you’re the recipient) or the courier company (if you’re the sender). This tracking number is typically given to you at the time of booking or shipment, and it allows you to track the parcel’s journey from the sender’s location to the destination.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Visit the Paxi Tracking Website</strong>
                    <p>To start tracking your parcel, visit the <a href="https://www.paxitrack.com" class="btn" target="_blank">Paxi website</a> or use their official app (if available). You can also use third-party websites that offer Paxi tracking services. On the official Paxi website, look for the section dedicated to parcel tracking.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enter Your Tracking Number</strong>
                    <p>Once you are on the tracking page, you’ll be prompted to enter your tracking number in the provided field. Type the number exactly as it appears, making sure to include all characters and digits. If you have any doubts about your tracking number, double-check it with the sender or review your shipping confirmation email.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Click "Track" or "Search"</strong>
                    <p>After entering the tracking number, click on the "Track" or "Search" button to initiate the search. The system will then fetch the most recent tracking information available for your parcel.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Review the Tracking Information</strong>
                    <p>Once the system pulls up your parcel’s tracking information, you’ll be able to view the current status of your package. Depending on how far along the parcel is in its journey, you will be shown various details, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Parcel Origin:</strong> Where the parcel was sent from.</li>
